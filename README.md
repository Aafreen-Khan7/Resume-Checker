# 📝 Resume Analyzer Based on Job Description

This is an AI-powered Resume Analyzer tool that reads a resume PDF and compares it with a job description to calculate the **ATS (Applicant Tracking System) match score**, suggests the **best-suited role**, and gives **recommendations for improvement**. 

The project uses **Gradio** for UI and leverages **OCR, NLP**, and keyword-matching to identify relevant skills and match the resume to job roles.
